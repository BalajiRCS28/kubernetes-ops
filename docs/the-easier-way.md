The easier way
================
This is not exactly the easy way but way easier than [the-manual-way.md](the-manual-way.md).

This methods walks you through how to create the VPC and a Kops cluster via
the scripts we provide instead of using the CLIs manually.  However, if you wanted
to learn what exactly it is doing and we encourage you to go through the [the-manual-way.md](the-manual-way.md)
once sometime.
